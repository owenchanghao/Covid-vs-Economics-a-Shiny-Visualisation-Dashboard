Hi! This is a visualisation dashboard constructed by Changhao Li (from the University of Sydney) and his teammates. The visualisation dashboard consists a variety of data, including daily new cases, Apple mobility score, total covid tests and so on, from April 1, 2020 til April 17, 2021.

I want to thank my group mates, especially Lauren Khoo (SG) for her significant contribution.
