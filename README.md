Hi! This is a visualisation dashboard constructed by Changhao Li (from the University of Sydney) and his teammates. The visualisation dashboard consists a variety of data, including daily new cases, Apple mobility score, total covid tests and so on, from April 1, 2020 til April 17, 2021.

### Executive Summary

The year 2020 was one of statistical importance as epidemiologists, economists, and health professionals rushed to understand the nature of COVID-19 and its pronounced effects on society. From this, large volumes of data and statistics have been made readily available to the public, ranging from societal measures to financial metrics to health-related measures. This report aims to detail the methodologies used to aggregate these various interdisciplinary metrics into a single socioeconomic variable - a rebound score; we’ve deployed a Shiny visualisation dashboard around this rebound score to more easily explore and understand the impact of COVID-19 on different countries’ socioeconomic climates.

Our visualisation dashboard showcases various financial, societal, and health-related aspects of 61 countries as well as their final rebound scores. Different countries’ rebound score rankings show reasonableness and usefulness as they agree with external data rankings when cross-checked against external data sources. Featuring user-interface options that allow variables to be visualised together with smoothing options, our app will be helpful for our primary audience of retail and institutional investors in making geographical investment decisions in the short-term. It will also assist our secondary audiences of academic researchers in socioeconomics as well as the general public in informing and realising trends between different countries. Together, our overall results fulfil our aim in a clear manner for visualisation and comparisons.

I want to thank my group mates, especially Lauren Khoo (SG) for her significant contribution.
